One of the interesting projects I worked on is Tele-operation of a Cable-driven robot via Touch haptic device. I was appointed by my supervisor to establish a communication schema between the two hardware robots. The Cable robot is running on a Golang program while the Touch is running on C++ program. So, a websocket communication is established  to have bi-lateral channel for sending/receiving data. Finally, the user can interactively control the velocity of the Cable robot from the Touchâ€™s workspace.
