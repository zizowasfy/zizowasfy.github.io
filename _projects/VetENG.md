Participation in the Erasmus +KA2 VET-ENG project and achievement of Joint Project (NU â€“ GBAUTO) program. The program involved working in teams of industrial high school students and undergrad engineering students. Each team chose a hardware model and work on designing, manufacturing, and developing the model into a working prototype.

My work in this project was mostly dedicated to:

-	Design a 3D model of a 3D-printer using SOLIDWORKS software.
-	Designing the control box layout for the 3D-printer hardware.
-	Manufacturing and assembling of the 3D-printer parts.
-	Integrating the mechanical design and the electrical board.
-	Testing and developing for higher output accuracy.
