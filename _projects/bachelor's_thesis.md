This is the very first project I got introduced to working with ROS, intensely. My team and I were the first to work on such application in the region. We participated with the project in a couple of regional competitions: 

> 
* DELL EMC Technologies annual challenge for graduation projects from senior undergraduate students 2022. (Awarded the 5th place :dart:)
* Egypt IOT & AI challenge competition, graduation projects category 2020. (Awarded the 1st place :trophy:)
